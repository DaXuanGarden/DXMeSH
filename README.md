## 🐾 Future Updates
The future updates are eagerly anticipated. We are committed to creating a comprehensive, precise, and efficient medical paper search tool:

1️⃣ **Automated Search and Output**: After generating search terms, perform the search with one click and output structured table files, integrating information such as journal impact factors and title translations.

2️⃣ **Intuitive Term Visualization**: One-click visualization features, including word clouds and bar charts, to display high-frequency terms and research trends vividly.

3️⃣ **AI Literature Summarization**: Future versions will incorporate artificial intelligence technology to automatically summarize literature content, providing intelligent support for researchers.

4️⃣ **Resource Library Construction**: Based on the methodology of the "Scientific Research Theory," create a research material library with one click, aiding in the deepening of medical paper writing and research thought processes.


> `DXMeSH` is inspired by `Professor Zhong's "Scientific Research Theory,"` striving to create a one-stop solution for medical paper search, resource library construction, and term visualization.
